## About [&#x219F;](#table-of-contents)

This project has a long history of not coming into being, despite there being a need for it in the LFE community from fairly early in the language's history. The [initial impetus](https://github.com/lfe/lfe/issues/153) and all subsquent community feature requests have been 100% inspired by what the larger Clojure community has in the [nREPL](https://nrepl.org/nrepl/1.1/index.html) project.

The xrepl project has as its primary mission:

> To explore strange new LFE REPL use cases, to seek out new REPL features and new interactive development possibilities, to boldly go where LFE-proper hasn't gone. Yet.

Anything good that comes out of this project that may be even remotely useful to LFE itself will result in a ticket and/or a PR against the LFE repository for Robert's reading pleasure and discretionary approval.
